# 🛍️ Shop Smart AI Recommender - LLMOps Project

Welcome to the **Shop Smart AI Recommender**! This project showcases a complete, end-to-end LLMOps pipeline for a conversational AI application. The system provides intelligent product recommendations based on real customer reviews, all wrapped in a modern, cloud-native architecture.

---

### 🚀 Project Overview

This application provides intelligent product recommendations using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture. It demonstrates:

-   **Local Development**: Building a robust Python application with a clear, modular structure.
-   **Containerization**: Packaging the application and its dependencies using Docker for portability.
-   **Cloud Deployment**: Orchestrating the entire application stack on a Google Cloud VM using Kubernetes (Minikube).
-   **Secure Configuration**: Managing secrets and API keys safely with Kubernetes Secrets.
-   **Real-time Monitoring**: Observing application health and performance with Prometheus and Grafana.
-   **CI/CD Ready**: A clean project structure ready for future automation workflows.
